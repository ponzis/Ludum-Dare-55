#Idea is that interacting with this item checks flags and then sets a bunch of flags
#flags to check
#@export var 

#Set flags on events...

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
#func _ready():
#	#print(self.game_manager.game_flags)
#	pass


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
